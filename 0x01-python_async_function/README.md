# Python Async Functions
This is what the tasks in this project will cover:
* Asynchronous IO (async IO): a language-agnostic paradigm (model) that has implementations across a host of programming languages
* async/await: two new Python keywords that are used to define coroutines
* asyncio: the Python package that provides a foundation and API for running and managing coroutines
## Project Concepts
- Parallelism
- Concurrency
- Threading
- Cooperative multitasking
## Objectives
At the end of this project, the following activities was achieved:
- async and await syntax
- How to execute an async program with asyncio
- How to run concurrent coroutines
- How to create asyncio tasks
- How to use the random module
