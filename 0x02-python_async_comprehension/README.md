# Python - Async Comprehension
Async comprehensions in Python allow you to use async and await with comprehensions, making it easier to work with asynchronous iterables in a concise way. This is useful when you need to collect results from asynchronous operations efficiently.
## Tasks Objectives
The tasks in this this project, helps to butress the following concepts:

- How to write an asynchronous generator
- How to use async comprehensions
- How to type-annotate generators
